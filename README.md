### the most interesting insights about the analysis carried out

1 -  Regency Cakestand 3 Tier is the product that is canceled the most, it would be interesting to understand with customers why canceled the purchase of this product

2 - I checked the products that are usually bought together, it might be interesting to create promotional campaigns,
with the set of these products by inserting one more

3 - identify why such a low % of customers buy more than one product in a single transactio
